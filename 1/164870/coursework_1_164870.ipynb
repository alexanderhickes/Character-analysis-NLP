    "The code below is taking reviews about books from an Amazon corpus reader. I have provided a word list size of 300 as a means to test its accuracy against a Naive Bayes Classifier.\n",

    "A wordlist classifier will take a word, for example: 'bad', and assign a sentiment value: negative. A Naive Bayes classifier will look at a word, and assigns a probability on the sentiment: the word 'bad' is used negatively 80% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the results below, Accuracy of a Naive Bayes classifier will be greater than that of a wordlist. If you run the code multiple times, you will see that the accuracies vary per run. This is due to training the classifiers on a particular data, and then testing them on another. Given that a wordlist classifier will directly assign a sentiment to a word, and a Naive Bayes assigns the likelihood of a words sentiment, these will depend on the samples used in the training data. I also found that Wordlist classifiers will guess the classification of a word if it is unknown, where as a Naive Bayes has properties like 'unknown value' to help this issue. \n",

    "Below I have collected individual test/train data from 4 categories: dvd, book, kitchen and electronics. I then compare each source, and output the result as a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see from the graph that the best results achieved when the source and target data come from the same category. This is because the context of the classifier will be similar if trained in the same environment that it is tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "When testing across categories, you find the best results when comparing 'electronics' and 'kitchen'. This would make sense as  \n",
    "'kitchen' can be interpreted as a child of electronics: most items constituting a kitchen are electronic now a day. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the categories that returned the worst results, you will see this is within 'book' and 'electronics'. This is because it is very hard to analyse sentiment between fictional (E.g - a novel) and non-fictional (E.g - a personal review on a washing machine). For example, the word 'broken' can refer to 'broken English', which describes the dialogue of Marlon James' bestseller: 'A brief history of seven killings'. 'Broken' does not bare a negative connotation in this context. However, the use of 'broken' in an electronic review bares a very heavy negative connotation. This is a potential explanation of why training a classifier via 'book' and testing it on 'electronics' showed the worst accuracy.   \n"

It was interesting to find that, despite training a classifier on 'dvd' and 'book', then testing this on either 'electronics' or 'kitchen', you still got similar (sometimes worse) results then just cross-testing a classifier from one domain. The last four results in the table show accuracy improves when training multiple categories, including itself. These Provided accuracies within a range of 0.01 (excluding 24). "

    "If you look at the results table, you can see the range between accuracies is greatly reduced, and the overall classification of all categories is much higher than previous, with all categories averaging around 0.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories with the greatest accuracy where the 'kitchen' and 'electronics' categories. They performed best on 'lower' and 'stem' FE. This is because these categories are more subjective then fictional reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "'dvd' outperformed all categories stem FE. This could be due to the nature in which people write 'dvd' reviews: larger use of affixes.  'book' preformed the worst overall. This could be down to the interpretation. 'Electronics' have a set purpose to preform operations, so peoples reviews tightly cohere around the purpose. A 'book' has no real purpose, and can have loose interpretations. This makes it hard to train a classifier on data which is loosely attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting on punctuation and stopwords had the smallest range across all categories. I would assume this is because people pay more attention to formality when writing a public review, as opposed to just describing something to a friend.\n"

From extension A, I have implemented tests for whether the dependency is amod (adjective modifier) or advmod (adverbial modifier). If these conditions are met, the strings are concatenated and stored in the opinions set. There is also a test for negation (provided from extension E, which appends 'not-' to the beginning of the string.\n",

    "This section is an analysis of whether the opinion extractor works on the sample of sentences provided. I have been provided with 9 core sentences. From the output provided below, I can conclude my program successfully computes the required words. By appending tokens to their relevant children, you are able to concatenate relevant words without limitations on the size of a sentence. This would not be possible without the use of a recursive call that analyses any further conjunctives.\n",
    "\n",
    "One detail I noticed was that the set containing the opinions sometimes reversed the order of words. For example, 'The plot was cheesy, but fun and inspiring.' should produce: 'cheesy, 'fun', 'inspiring'. My code produced: 'inspiring', 'fun', 'cheesy'. This depends on how you traverse a tree. As I am looking at children (not ancestors), I would expect words to be appended as they are iterated through. This is not the case. I believe this is due to the retrieval of the words from the 'results' tuple, but I cannot be certain as this issue is inconsistent. It could be due to 'opinions/result' being a set, not a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is in regards to varying the aspect words. The same results were produced when testing various aspects. This error is due to the way results are stored. All aspects are being iterated through, and appended to the same result. This is evident if you uncomment line: 101 - 103. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom is code which has been commented out. This is in regards to the optional sentences. Out of 7 sentences, 4 returned successful (A, B, C and G). On analysis of dependency trees, you can see how some of these sentences have varied dependencies and part of speech, hence why they fail. If we look at sentence: 'The plot is full of holes.', my algorithm detects 'is' as a verb. It will then detect 'full' as the 'ADJ' and append this to opinions. However, 'of' and 'holes' has dependencies/part of speech which my code does not detect, and therefore doesn't append it. When adapting my code to accommodate for this sentence, I found my core sentences were becoming affected. This is because the logic pattern provided through extensions A - E didn't comply, and hence I would need to create far more complex functions to deal with varied sentence structures. "

    "If you inspect the file: 'OpinionExtractorData.txt', you will find an analysis of 100 reviews taken from 'my_sample'. This produces a list of sentences, with the opinion provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentences were generated by looking through 'results' and finding how many sentences are contained (lines: 85 - 91). This is misleading, as A) duplicate sentences are contained, B) Some sentences contain opinions of multiple categories, and C) supplement aspect words (E.g - 'cinematography' is supplemented with words like 'photography', 'direction' and 'scenery') are present, but still correctly evaluated. I have then gone through each sentence finding which contain the relevant aspect word of the search. I then evaluated them on what I thought the output should be, and the actual output. Sentences I have classed as partially correct, partial error (due to either part of speech tagger, dependency or code deficiency), or correct in 'OpinionExtractorEval.pdf', I have considered successful computations. I have also stated which extension is applied. You will see that the majority of sentences returning partial correctness are associated to extension B. This is because it is only interrogating verbs, no check if word is an ancestor for the aspect. When applicable, extension A was most successful. This is due to ease of computing based on sentence structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct evaluation was generated on a manual overview of the file. This analysis is contained in 'OpinionExtractorEval.pdf'. For each aspect, I found all sentences containing their relevant noun (many sentences did not, or contained a supplement. I did not consider suppliments in correctness), and scored it based on my judgement of what the opinion should be. \n",
    "'Characters' seemed to provide the best results. I believe this is because sentences containing 'character' had clear references (E.g - 'Excellent characters, fantastic acting and wonderful settings' Produced 'Excllent' via extension A). Some sentences had complex structures that didn't produce ideal outputs. I classed these as partially correct (E.g - 'By the end of movie you don't like any of the characters and you don't care what happens to them, even the ones that started out sympathetic and likable.' Produced: 'not-like', 'likable', 'sympathetic', 'not-care', 'that'. I classed this as a partially successful evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the output, you can see that there is at least one opinion provided for every sentence. However, the usefulness of the opinions provided can vary. When looking at short precise sentences, the usefulness is evident. For example, take sentence: 'The mood, cinematography, the soundtrack is all great'. There is a clear opinion on the mood, cinematography, and soundtrack: 'great'. This is accurately produced in the output: 'great' via extension B. Another sentence: 'The dialogue is wonderful, all of the performances are superb, and Capra's direction are excellent'. Provides a concise description. This produces and output of 'wonderful', 'superb, and 'excellent' via extensions B and D. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another computed sentence using extension E was: 'As one can imagine, these characters are almost always pathetic'. There is a description of the characters being pathetic. The output has produced 'always-pathetic'. Although successful, it has missed the detail 'almost-always-pathetic'. One can say this information is minimal in terms of defining the opinion. The reason this has been missed from the output is that my program only checks for 'conj' dependencies in order to iterate through multiple children. 'always' is the first child of 'pathetic', and there is currently no test for whether there is a further advmod dependency from 'always'. This is a deficiency in the opinion extractor.\n",
    "\n",
    "When applicable, extension D was very successful. One sentence that failed was: 'None of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying.' should produce: 'not-believable'. However, the output is 'believable'. It is obvious that the output of the opinion is the opposite of what it should be, as the negation has been processed incorrectly. When observing the tree diagram, there is no negation present in the sentence, and therefore the program cannot successfully compute this sentence. Another sentence: 'By the end of movie you don't like any of the characters and you don't care what happens to them, even the ones that started out sympathetic and likable' produced 'likable', 'sympathetic' and 'that'.

    "More complex sentences like: 'What sets the film apart from other WWII/Hitler films is that the characters are portrayed as human beings -- NOT stereotypical Hollywood caricatures.' The output produces 'What'. This is not an opinion. However, it would be quiet difficult for a person to denote the opinion on such a sentence, let alone a simple opinion extractor. This sentence has clearly failed. This is due to errors made by the part-of-speech tagger\n",

    "After examining a number of varying sentences, I can conclude that, if the sentence structure is similarly to the core sentences used to build this extractor, it has a very successful computation rate. As the tree structures become more complex, this rate tends to decrease. A big element on success is the way the sentence is written: 'If the plot were better it would be a film worth watching' does not provide an opinion on the film; more or an opinion on what it is not.\n",

    "Looking at the sentence: 'As one can imagine, these characters are almost always pathetic' used above, I could have extended the ‘interrogate’ to accommodate for continuous 'advmod' dependencies. This would provide a more accurately concatenated string including the word: 'almost-always-pathetic'. When I tried to implement this in the same opinion extractor, I was getting errors in my results for the core sentences. Due to huge variety of way to display and interpret a sentence, it is very hard to accommodate for all styles, without disrupting others. \n",

    "There are also issues when it comes to providing analysis on the aspect words. If a noun, which is not in the aspect words, appears, due to the structure of having two parts, a verb will be taken. These usually come in the form of 'that' or 'was'. This is an error in the deficiency of the program, which takes a verb and searches for a child that is an adjective. To solve this, I would need to adapt my extractor so it checks the root of a word, ensuring it's ancestor is related to the aspect word.\n",

    "Overall, considering large limitations on the styles of reviews, I found my opinion extractor was very successful on providing analysis for reviews similar to the ones provided in the core sentences.\n"
