    "## Overview\n",
    "In this topic you will be looking at ways to extract opinion bearing words from DVD Amazon reviews. The goal is to find words that describe particular aspects of the film being reviewed. The specific aspects of films that we will be considering are: the **plot**, the **characters**, the **cinematography** and the **dialogue**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are, in other words, interested in finding all of those words in a review that express the reviewers opinion about one of these aspects of the film. The idea is that this will provide a fine-grained characterisation of the opinion being expressed by the author of the review. We will refer to the words we are looking for as **opinion words**, and refer to the words used for particular aspects of the review as **aspect words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following on from previous topic's material on dependency parsing, you will use the spaCy's output as the basis for identifying opinion words. This is based on the assumption that the opinion words we are looking for are words that occur in a sentence in the review in a particular (dependency) relationship to one of our aspect words (plot, characters, cinematography and dialogue).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the opinion word \"*amazing*\" might be found because it is used in a sentence where it is an adjective modifying the aspect word \"*plot*\", as in the sentence \"*I thought it had an amazing plot.*\".\n",

    "## Tips for de-bugging and exploration\n",
    "When you will be assessing whether your opinion extractor has been effective when analysing a given sentence. Before you look at what the dependency parser says, read the sentence carefully and determine for yourself the scope of the words. Consider the following sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This film has excellent characters and an intriguing and engaging plot.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be obvious to you that here the plot is described as both \"intriguing\" and \"engaging\". However, \"excellent\" is only used to describe the cinematography.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the parser suggests a structure which implies that plot is also described by \"excellent\" (for example), something has gone wrong.### Dependency tree visualisation tool\n",
    "You may find it useful to use the dependency tree visualisation tool found [here](https://demos.explosion.ai/displacy).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy and past example sentences from the DVD review data to get a good sense of what the dependency parse looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputing results only from sentences relevant to the current task\n",
    "You will find that your output is dominated by examples of adjectival modification and adjectives linked via the copula. This means that when you add a new function (extensions 3-5) it will be difficult to determine the impact of that new functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to solve this problem, is to (temporarily) output only those features produced by the new functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you have just completed extensions 1 and 2. Next, you write code that adds the adverbial features (extension 3). When assessing how well your code is working, let your extractor only extract the \"new\" adverb features.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 easy ways to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Comment out any extractor code that produces features that you're not currently interested in. Or\n",
    "2. Introduce a boolean variable, which you only set to `True` when you have extracted the feature that you are interested in. Then always ouput an empty list if the variable is `False`, otherwise output the full opinion list."
