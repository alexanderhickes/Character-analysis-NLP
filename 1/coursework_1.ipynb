    "\n",
    "**Submission format:**  \n",
    "You should submit just one file that should be a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due date:**  \n",
    "Your notebook should be submitted on Study Direct before 4pm on Wednesday 30th November. The standard late penalties will apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return date:**  \n",
    "Marks and feedback will be provided on Sussex Direct on Friday December 21st for all submissions that are submitted by the due date.\n",

    "**Weighting:**  \n",
    "This assessment contributes 50% of the mark for the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word limit:**  \n",
    "Your Jupyter notebook should contain no more than 3000 words. The standard penalties apply for deviations from this limit (see below). You *must* specify the number of words in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure to observe limits of length\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is taken from the Examination and Assessment Regulations Handbook \n",
    "\n",
    ">The maximum length for each assessment is publicised to students. The limits as stated include quotations in the text, but do not include the bibliography, footnotes/endnotes, appendices, abstracts, maps, illustrations, transcriptions of linguistic data, or tabulations of numerical or linguistic data and their captions. Any excess in length should not confer an advantage over other students who have adhered to the guidance. Students are requested to state the word count on submission. Where a student has marginally (within 10%) exceeded the word length the Marker should penalise the work where the student would gain an unfair advantage by exceeding the word limit. In excessive cases (>10%) the Marker need only consider work up to the designated word count, and discount any excessive word length beyond that to ensure equity across the cohort. Where an assessment is submitted and falls significantly short (>10%) of the word length, the Marker must consider in assigning a mark, if the argument has been sufficiently developed and is sufficiently supported and not assign the full marks allocation where this is not the case.\n",

    "- Topic 3 concerned the classification of Amazon product reviews according to whether the overall sentiment being expressed was positive or negative. You explored factors that have an impact on classifier accuracy. \n",

    "- Topic 6 involved extending an opinion extractor function so that it deals with a variety of ways that opinions are expressed in Amazon DVD reviews. \n",

    "For this report you should create a Jupyter notebook containing the following sections (further details regarding the content of each section are given below).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 1**:  \n",
    "A report on what you discovered while undertaking some of the exercises in the Topic 3 notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 2**:  \n",
    "The python code for your opinion extractor and a description of how it works. This section should also include a demonstration that your opinion extractor produces the correct output for the example sentences that we have given for each of the required extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 3**:  \n",
    "An assessment of the limitations of your extractor based on applying it to your own personalised random sample of 100 sentences from the corpus of DVD amazon reviews (see below for details of how to obtain your personalised random sample).\n",

    "There are 30 marks available for this section. Section 1 should include the following four subsections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1.1   (7 marks) \n",
    "You investigated the differences in accuracy between the wordlist classifier performance and the Naïve Bayes classifier performance. In this subsection, describe what you found, and, by looking at classifier performance on a sample of product reviews (it is up to you to decide how many), discuss the reasons behind the differences in performance of the  methods being compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1.2 (7 marks)\n",
    "For the methods that require training data, you investigated the impact on classifier accuracy when the amount of training data is varied? In this subsection you should discuss your findings, and then attempt to predict what the accuracy of the Naïve Bayes classifier would be if you massively increased the amount of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1.3 (8 marks)\n",
    "You investigated the impact on classifier accuracy of training a classifier with data in one domain (the source domain), and testing the same classifier on data from a different domain (the target domain). In this subsection you should describe what you found, and then investigate the reasons why some source to target changes in domain have more impact on classifier accuracy than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1.4 (8 marks)\n",
    "In this subsection you should discuss what you found when investigating the impact on classifier accuracy of various feature extraction methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to note\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quality of your experimental method \n",
    " - make sure that you make an appropriate division of labelled data for training and testing \n",
    " - make sure that you have repeated experiments with different random samples and presented averaged results\n",
    "- Presentation of results\n",
    " - graphs or tables should be used when presenting your empirical findings \n",
    " - when you are making a comparison between two or more results,  you should display them together on the same graph so that the comparison can be seen directly.\n",
    " - in cases where your empirical investigation is not complete, be explicit as to what you have not managed to achieve. \n",
    "- Quality of analysis\n",
    " - do not just present tables of numbers and graphs without any discussion. You need to put forward a reasonable explanation as to why you have observed the results that you have obtained. \n",
    " - Always back up claims with evidence.  Be careful not to make bold conclusions from small-scale testing.\n",
